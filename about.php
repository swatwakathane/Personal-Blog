        Content available on swatwakathane.com and documents generated using the Service are 
        intended for general information purposes only. Although all clauses and provisions inside the 
        generator database have been drafted by me and regularly undergo 
        reviews and updates, documents are generated in a fully automated manner and therefore do not constitute or 
        substitute the rendering of legal advice, nor does any assistance and customer support provided by me 
        establish a relationship. This is why, despite all efforts in offering the best possible 
        service, Swatwa Kathane cannot guarantee that generated documents be fully compliant with applicable law. Users should 
        therefore not rely upon documents 
        generated without seeking legal advice from an attorney licensed in the relevant jurisdiction(s).
